## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep violet (#9466FF), evocative of creative arts.
- Background color: Light grayish-violet (#F2F0FF) to allow the primary color to 'pop'.
- Accent color: Turquoise (#66FFDA) to signal points of interaction.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern look suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use a consistent set of minimalist icons that represent different idea categories and actions. Icons should be easily recognizable and contribute to the clean, modern aesthetic.
- The layout should prioritize clarity and ease of navigation, with a focus on presenting ideas in a structured and visually appealing manner. Use a grid-based system to maintain consistency across different screen sizes.
- Incorporate subtle animations to enhance user interaction, such as smooth transitions when expanding and collapsing mind map nodes. Animations should be purposeful and not distracting.
